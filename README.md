# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using various techniques, including content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and a hybrid approach that combines both techniques. The system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Content-Based Filtering

The content-based filtering technique recommends movies based on the similarity of their attributes to the user's preferences. It analyzes the content of the movies, such as genres, cast, and plot keywords, to make recommendations. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from the movie descriptions and apply cosine similarity to find similar movies.

## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering recommends movies based on the behavior of other users. It analyzes the ratings given by users to movies and identifies similar users or movies to make recommendations. The system implements collaborative filtering using the Surprise library in Python, which provides various algorithms such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for recommendation.

## Hybrid Recommendation System

The hybrid recommendation system combines both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to improve the quality of recommendations. It leverages the strengths of both approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. The system first uses collaborative filtering to generate initial recommendations and then uses content-based filtering to re-rank the recommendations based on the content similarity.
